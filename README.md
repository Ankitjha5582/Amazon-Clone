I've built a project on Amazon Clone using only only HTML and CSS to strengthen my front-end design and layout skills. 
With this project, I explored: 
-> HTML Semantic : stucturing a complex e-commerce layout. 
-> CSS Flexbox & Grid : creating responsive product grids and navigation. 
-> Styling & Layout : replicating real-world E-Commerce UI patterns.
